Hello world


I am following DDD software design, and now its time to create catalog/domain/service/ProductDomainService.java, 
Can you create this class, and while you're building this class, take the SOLID and other software enginerring principle into your consideration to follow careflully. 

When you're done write a doc in doc for the class, generally about what this class does, why it's needed, and the principles you applied and why you applied them? (SOLID and etc...). 

Thanks
