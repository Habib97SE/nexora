# ProductDomainService Documentation

## Overview

The `ProductDomainService` is a critical component in our Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture that encapsulates complex business logic related to Product aggregates. This service acts as the central orchestrator for Product domain operations, ensuring business rules are consistently enforced across the application.

## What This Class Does

The `ProductDomainService` provides a comprehensive set of operations for managing Product entities while enforcing domain-specific business rules and invariants. It serves as the primary interface for complex Product operations that cannot be naturally encapsulated within the Product entity itself.

### Core Responsibilities

1. **Product Lifecycle Management**: Handles creation, updates, and deactivation of products
2. **Business Rule Enforcement**: Validates and enforces complex business constraints
3. **Cross-Aggregate Operations**: Manages operations that involve multiple domain objects
4. **Domain Logic Coordination**: Orchestrates complex business processes
5. **Audit and Logging**: Provides comprehensive logging for business operations

### Key Operations

- **Product Creation**: Creates new products with full validation
- **Product Updates**: Updates existing products while preserving invariants
- **Stock Management**: Handles stock adjustments with business rule validation
- **Category Management**: Manages product-category relationships
- **Price Management**: Handles price updates with audit trails
- **Product Deactivation**: Implements soft-delete patterns with business constraints

## Why This Class Is Needed

### 1. **Domain Logic Encapsulation**
The service encapsulates business logic that doesn't naturally belong to a single entity but is essential to the Product domain. This includes:
- Cross-entity validation (e.g., name uniqueness within categories)
- Complex business rules (e.g., stock adjustment constraints)
- Multi-step operations (e.g., product lifecycle management)

### 2. **Business Rule Centralization**
Instead of scattering business logic across controllers, repositories, or entities, the service provides a single point of truth for Product domain rules:
- Consistent validation across all operations
- Centralized business rule maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Transaction Management**
The service provides proper transaction boundaries for complex operations:
- Ensures data consistency across multiple operations
- Handles rollback scenarios appropriately
- Maintains ACID properties for business operations

### 4. **Domain Integrity**
The service ensures that domain invariants are maintained:
- Prevents invalid state transitions
- Enforces business constraints
- Maintains referential integrity

## Software Engineering Principles Applied

### SOLID Principles

#### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Applied**: The service has one clear responsibility: managing Product domain operations
- **Why**: Each method focuses on a specific aspect of Product management
- **Benefit**: Easy to understand, test, and maintain

```java
// Each method has a single, clear responsibility
public Product createProduct(Product product) { ... }
public Product adjustStock(UUID productId, int quantityAdjustment) { ... }
public Product updatePrice(UUID productId, Money newPrice) { ... }
```

#### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Applied**: The service is open for extension but closed for modification
- **Why**: New business rules can be added without changing existing code
- **Benefit**: Stable core functionality with extensible behavior

```java
// New validation rules can be added without modifying existing methods
private void validateProductCreation(Product product) {
    validateBasicProductRules(product);
    validateCategoryIsActive(product.getCategory());
    validateNameUniquenessInCategory(product.getName(), product.getCategory().getId(), null);
    // New rules can be added here without changing existing validation
}
```

#### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Applied**: The service can be substituted with different implementations
- **Why**: Depends on abstractions (ProductRepository interface)
- **Benefit**: Flexible implementation and easy testing

```java
// Depends on abstraction, not concrete implementation
private final ProductRepository productRepository;
```

#### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Applied**: The service provides focused, cohesive operations
- **Why**: Clients only depend on methods they actually use
- **Benefit**: Reduced coupling and improved maintainability

#### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- **Applied**: Depends on abstractions (ProductRepository) rather than concrete implementations
- **Why**: Enables loose coupling and testability
- **Benefit**: Easy to mock dependencies and test in isolation

### Additional Design Principles

#### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
- **Applied**: Encapsulates domain logic, not infrastructure concerns
- **Why**: Maintains clear domain boundaries
- **Benefit**: Business logic is independent of technical implementation

```java
// Domain logic, not infrastructure concerns
private void validateNameUniquenessInCategory(String productName, String categoryId, String excludeProductId) {
    // Business rule validation, not database queries
}
```

#### 2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
- **Applied**: Common validation logic is extracted into private methods
- **Why**: Reduces code duplication and maintenance overhead
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for business rules

```java
// Reusable validation methods
private void validateBasicProductRules(Product product) { ... }
private void validateCategoryIsActive(Category category) { ... }
```

#### 3. **Fail Fast Principle**
- **Applied**: Validation occurs early in the operation
- **Why**: Prevents invalid operations from proceeding
- **Benefit**: Clear error messages and efficient resource usage

```java
// Early validation prevents unnecessary processing
public Product createProduct(Product product) {
    validateProductCreation(product); // Fail fast
    // ... rest of the operation
}
```

#### 4. **Tell, Don't Ask**
- **Applied**: The service tells the domain what to do, rather than asking for information
- **Why**: Encapsulates behavior within the domain
- **Benefit**: Maintains domain integrity and reduces coupling

#### 5. **Command Query Separation (CQS)**
- **Applied**: Methods either perform actions (commands) or return data (queries)
- **Why**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Benefit**: Predictable behavior and easier testing

```java
// Commands (modify state)
public Product createProduct(Product product) { ... }
public Product updateProduct(UUID productId, Product updatedProduct) { ... }

// Queries (return data)
public Product findProductById(UUID productId) { ... }
```

## Business Rules Enforced

### 1. **Product Creation Rules**
